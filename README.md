## AssemblyScript Audio

This is just a subset of Audio DSP and MIDI related AssemblyScript code from @petersalomonsen's awesome [javascriptmusic](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/javascriptmusic/) project's "synth1". It's purpose is to make it easier to compile a wasm file for use in the [dart_synth](https://github.com/maks/dart_synth) project.
